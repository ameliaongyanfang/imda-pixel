### What is this about?

We’ve heard a lot about how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can transform the way we work – and how we operate our business.

But how does AI work in real-life as a **digital transformation** tool to develop new solutions?

And how can the principles of Design Thinking help us ensure that AI solutions are developed with the end user at the heart of it all?

 

This workshop will cover the following topics:

*        What is AI technology?
*        Identifying the problem you want to solve
*        Defining the value and competitive advantage of AI for your business unit
*        How to implement AI effectively
*        Change management
